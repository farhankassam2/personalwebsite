# personalwebsite


**Update as of May 26, 2021: the website host shut down my account because I think they required paid accounts. So the website is down until further notice!**

The following project comprises of the code that I have worked on over summer in creating my own website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This was a great opportunity for me to learn and enhance my knowledge and skills of these three languages

I have not completed the project yet but I am currently working on a login feature in order to be able to put the information that users provide into an excel workshop

I am using PHP to achieve the above login feature and so I am still in the process of learning how to use PHP and the excel browser connection feature to connect the front end to the back end

I have put my code up simply to show employers the work I have done so far to assess the level of technicality that I have engaged with
